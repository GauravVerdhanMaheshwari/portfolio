NOTE :- If you are downloading this repo. Do know that you have to install all the dependences of both directory i.e Frontend one and backend one 
And also credits are needed :) 

To install all the dependences 
Run the following command 

```
cd ./portfolio/portfolioBackend
npm i
```
and same with the front end one 


This repo contion my (Gaurav verdhan maheshwari's) portfolio website which is made from react and node.js 

Following is the structure of the file :- 

"portfolioBackend" directory contias all the backend code 

In this directory "server.js" is the server which help me to maniuplate all the blogs 

"portfolioFrontend" directroy contains all the frontend code 

The componets directory is the breck down part of site which can be broken down into parts like the "Header", "Footer", etc.

App.jsx is used as a routing part i.e. all the none chanceable part of the code like the header and the footer will be there and the cange able part that can be changed are put in the Outlet which is connected to the route provider in the main.jsx

This just the over view of the structure of the code there might be some missed part that I didn't explain either because of it being not explainable via simple lines or i forget to include them in this read me file.
